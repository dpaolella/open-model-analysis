The financial models are for behind-the-meter projects that buy and sell electricity at retail rates (residential and commercial), or front-of-meter projects that sell electricity at a price determined in a power purchase agreement (PPA) or at market prices. SAM also has financial models for third-party ownership and community solar financial structures. SAM can model large or small projects, ranging from residential rooftop photovoltaic installations to large concentrating solar power generation projects and wind farms. The SAM Software Development Kit (SDK) provides tools for integrating SAM into software projects developed in a variety of languages. It includes the Python package PySAM.
